- 👋 Hi, you might know me as @sdempsey123 but my name is Steve Dempsey.
- 👀 I’m interested in building websites and being a web designer. I am also interested in playing golf and spending time with my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve myself with the use of HTML, CSS, Java, Django, and Python, mainly becoming the best web designer I can be.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need a web designer.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my gmail account (steve.dempsey624@gmail.com) or my personal website (https://steveldempsey.com).
- 🖥️For my personal website, I did it through WordPress and I customized one of the themes to make it my own website. Actually, I have changed themes on my website three times since I started it in 2018.
- :teacher: I recently graduated from Coding Dojo web developer boot camp and now I'm ready to embark on my new career.
- 🏌️‍♂️My first project is about bad golfers, like myself. I wanted to give some encouragement to those who aren't very good with golfing, and just tell them that if you play within yourself, you can play on good golf courses. I used HTML, CSS, Java, Django, and Python to put this project together.
- 🧑‍🏭My next project focused on a local heating/air conditioning business. I want to show here that I can tailor my websites to the needs of customers. For instance, this project gives the feel for a business that cares about the local community. I used HTML, CSS, Java, Django, and Python to put this project together.
